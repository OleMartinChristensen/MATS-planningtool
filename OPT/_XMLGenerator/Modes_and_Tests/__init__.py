""" This package consist of modules which contain functions that are called exclusively from the *XML_generator_select*.

The functions are separated into modules depending on if they define a Mode, a Test, or a separate CMD. Depending on their definition, the functions either call for Macros and/or CMDs from the *Macros_Commands* package.
